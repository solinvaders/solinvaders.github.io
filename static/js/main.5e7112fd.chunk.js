I am currently studying for an Electrical and Renewable Energy Engineering degree over here in the UK which is a strong passion of mine alongside NFTs. I have been involved with crypto for a little while now and came across Solana NFTs not so long ago and the community is top tier. This is why I wanted to get involved myself to grow and build a strong, welcoming community around our awesome nostalgic art. I have been a big fan of video games growing up so to make our project based on a popular old school video game is just what we wanted to do and in the future, a Sol Invader game would be something very cool for us to bring out. Anyway, I am very excited to see where we can take this project and I hope to see you all in our Twitter spaces between October 25th and November 7th."}),Object(I.jsx)(S,{name:"Beau P (Community Manager)",src:"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/889524290838491188/900481250530295868/image0.jpg",children:"Hello there.
